    Technical documentation and specifications for message exchanges between
    hardware devices and sales clients in bus. All communication is to be done
    through MQTT with JSON as payload.

    Scope of this specification is primarly for Møre og Romsdal Fylkeskommune and
    FRAM, but the overall ambition is for a broad consensus with other operators and
    authorities.

      # Specification: Diagnostics

      Sends diagnostics information for device to sales clients. Could be used by
      sales clients to show alerts, debug and keep general status of connection
      information of different devices.

      - Topic: `/device/diagnostics`
      - Direction: Publish (Inbound to client)
      - JSON Schema: [diagnostics.schema.json](./diagnostics.schema.json)
      - MQTT QoS: 0 (Default)
      - Interval: On device startup and on request

      ## Description

      Devices should respond with diagnostics in two cases: on initial startup and as
      a response to a diagnostics check. See related topics in next section.

      # Specification: nfc

      When a passenger intends to use the service, they present their travel card,
      which may have a token referencing an account with corresponding travel rights.
      In cases where there is no token present, the serial number of the travel card
      will be used. If there is a customer account associated with that serial number,
      a potential token will be generated and written back to the travel card. See
      diagram for total flow.

      Token should be transmitted as base64 encoded URL string without padding.

      - Topic: `validators/nfc`
      - Direction: Publish (Inbound to client)
      - JSON Schema: [nfc.schema.json](./nfc.schema.json.json)
      - MQTT QoS: 1 (at least once)
      - Trigger: Once every time a passenger presents a travel card to the barcode
        reader.

      ## Card content dump

      If the device is configured accordingly, the complete content of the card can be
      transferred from the device, as depicted in the flow chart. This simplifies the
      client's perspective as it enables direct access to the card's content. Please
      refer to the `validators/configure` topic for the configuration flag that
      determines whether `cardContent` is set. Below are examples demonstrating the
      scenarios when `cardContent` is enabled.

      This concept is applicable in situations where the smart card holds various
      types of travel rights and there is a requirement to prioritize among them.
      Examples of such types include NOD (Name Origin Destination), account-based, and
      others.

      Only supported type for now is `nsd` and that needs to be set as `type`, for
      future proofing when new types are added.

      ## Examples

      ```json
      {
        "traceId": "543070fe-ef32-11ed-a05b-0242ac120003",

        "token": "CtYBCtMBCtN...VDRFNBKgsIpdicoAYQ4NeUdzAB"
      }
      ```

      - The APDU sub-processes are custom command transceive processes that utilize
        the [`apdu`](./apdu/) topics for communication and data exchange.
      - In the flow chart, the "Provider" refers to the Account Based Ticketing (ABT)
        provider. This provider handles tasks such as customer data management and
        ticket purchases within the ABT system.

      # Specification: Validation Response

      Response sent after finished validation on client. Response can be both success,
      fail and error. In the current specification the response method is limited to a
      variant type/enum, and it's up to the device to handle the proper response in
      form of icon, color and sound.

      Device should optionally recieve title and description if supported by the
      device.

      # Specification: APDU Receive

      Recieve result from commands passed through transmit topic. Will contain list of
      results corresponding to the results transmitted, with the same specified
      `commandId`s.

      `transceiveId` can be used to link `transmit` and `receive` events.
      `eventTimestamp` is the time the first command result is generated.

      - Direction: Publish (Inbound to client)
      - JSON Schema: [receive.schema.json](./receive.schema.json)
      - MQTT QoS: 1 (at least once)
      - Trigger: Result from transmitted commands.

      ## Hex and expected status

      All result frames should be represneted as hex, starting with 0x. See examples.
      If result of executing command does not match expected status prefix passed in
      the transmit event, result should be ommited.

      ### `0xAF` and continuation

      Continuation on `0xAF` is handled implicitly if `expStatus` as passed in by
      transmit is set as `0x00`. See description below.

      #### desfire (native)

      - If `expStatus=0x00` or empty and first bytes in response indicates more data
        (`0xAF`) the device should fetch all data until end and give result as
        concatinated byte array.
      - If `expStatus=0xAF` is transmitted it is not handled automatically by the
        device.

      # Specification: APDU Transmit

      Transmit series of APDU commands in hexadecimals. Each command with an specified
      ID. Commands will generate response passed from device to client on topic
      `validators/apdu/receive` with corresponding `commandId`.

      APDU commands can be used to read or write specific values from travel cards or
      other NFC based devices.

      `transceiveId` can be used to link `transmit` and `receive` events.
      `eventTimestamp` is the time the command transmit request is generated.

      - MQTT QoS: 1 (at least once)
      - Trigger: Result from transmitted commands.

      ## Hex and expected status

      All commands should be represented as hex, starting with 0x. See examples.
      Expected status is optional. If result of executing command does not match
      expected status prefix, result is ommited in the receive event.

      ### `0xAF` and continuation

      Continuation on `0xAF` is handled implicitly if `expStatus` is set as `0x00`,
      depending on apdu type. See description below.

      #### desfire (native)

      - If `expStatus=0x00` or empty and first bytes in response indicates more data

        concatinated byte array.
